## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In my last project, where I learned to work with other grid properties, I had a lot of work to position the content, I
had to delimit the size, align, etc. this one was much simpler, and the reason was that I placed all the content inside
a container div, which made the content delimited to the size of the container, and not to the size of the screen.
